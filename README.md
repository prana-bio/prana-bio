## Mission

**Prana** aims to provide a seamless platform for exploring, tracking, and protecting biodiversity on earth. 

- Right now, it gathers, organizes, aggregates, and surfaces insights from relevant public datasets so that users are brought closer than ever to the issue of biodiversity loss. 
- In the future, it aims to connect users with protection organizations, allow them to purchase biodiversity credits, track their progress, and ultimately help them protect biodiversity on earth.
