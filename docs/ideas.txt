IDEAS:
- dashboard for tracking your contributions to land and species conservation
- calculate trees saved KPI and over time
- calculate GHG emissions absorbed KPI and over time (constantly ticking up)
- certified "Prana" badges for hitting milestones
	- by species protected
	- by country
	- by ecosystem (mangrove, forest, coral reef, etc.)
	- by amount square km of land preserved
	- by trees planted
	- by amount of C02 saved
- dashboard for tracking biodiversity levels (mapbox)
- overlay of areas/countries that are at risk (richness index * development index * climate change index = risk index by country)
- overlay of species with protected area
- overlay of your contributions
- overlay of land that is protected
- kpi for impact relative to income
- manual round-up sites/ngos that offfer donations and funding to protect land
- eventually, sites/ngos can directly apply to be certified and added
- work with half world project for identifying areas within countries

PROBLEMS BEING SOLVED:
- being able to track your contributions
- being able to find new places to contribute
- being able to do this as an individual or an org
- being able to share this with your network (promote, or regulartory requirements, earn badges or rewards, share with network)
- beautiful and modern platform

DESIGN PLAN:

	- user/tenant dropdown
	- dashboard (selected by default)
	- stories
	- settings
	- prana logo top right

- dashboard tab
	- top row
	   - "dashboard" top left
	   - "country" search dropdown - to filter dashboard
	   - "share" top right
	- tabs
	   - global overview (default - kpis)
	   - my impact (kpis - can be by user/tenant and by country/globe)
	   - explorer map
	       - ratings (0-100) on richness, land risk, climate change rate
- settings tab
	- profile
	- account
	- payments
	- notifications


PHASE 1
   - design plan
   - make figma design (if needed)
   - build ui w/ dummy data
   - workshop db design (b2c and b2b) with nile team
   - design and create db
   - gather and populate data
   - extend ui w/ real data


PHASE 2
   - unit/integration testing
   - 3rd party auth
   - deployment
